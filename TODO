Notes to future self after October 2018 course

Start course at 10:30 (or ealier) to allow to finish on time
Shiny app very flaky. 
Practical exercise does not seem to be normally distributed all. Maybe change for alternative where normal distribution is more obvious?
Having to tick 1st column is factor seems to cause confusion. Maybe format all datasets in same way so this option isn't needed
